    The history of Egypt has been long and wealthy

    Much of Egypt's ancient history was a mystery until Egyptian hieroglyphs were 
    deciphered with the discovery and help of the Rosetta Stone.

    Among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is the Great Pyramid of Giza. 
    Ancient Egyptian civilization coalesced around 3150 BC with the political unification of
    Upper and Lower Egypt under the first king of the First Dynasty, Narmer.
    Predominantly native Egyptian rule lasted until the conquest by the Achaemenid Empire 
    in the sixth century BC. In 332 BC, Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great conquered 
    Egypt as he toppled the Achaemenids and established the short-lived Macedonian Empire, 
    which gave rise to the Hellenistic Ptolemaic Kingdom, founded in 305 BC by one of 
    Alexander's former generals, Ptolemy I Soter. 
    
    The Ptolemies had to fight native rebellions and were involved in foreign and civil wars
    that led to the decline of the kingdom and its final annexation by Rome.
    The death of Cleopatra ended the nominal independence of Egypt, resulting in Egypt's 
    becoming one of the provinces of the Roman Empire. 
    Roman rule in Egypt (including Byzantine) lasted from 30 BC to 641 AD, 
    with a brief interlude of control by the Sasanian Empire between 619 and 629, 
    known as Sasanian Egypt.[1] After the Muslim conquest of Egypt, parts of Egypt became 
    provinces of successive Caliphates and other Muslim dynasties: 
    Rashidun Caliphate (632-661), Umayyad Caliphate (661–750), Abbasid Caliphate (750–935),
    Fatimid Caliphate (909–1171), Ayyubid Sultanate (1171–1260), and the Mamluk Sultanate 
    (1250–1517). In 1517, Ottoman sultan Selim I captured Cairo, absorbing Egypt into the 
    Ottoman Empire.
